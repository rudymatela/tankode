Field Types
===========

For now, just an idea.

Templates for randomly generated fields.
(Decide a random border, then random obstacles?)

## borders

Border types:

* rectangle;

* ellipsis (random number of surrounding edges);

* rounded (a bit rounded, up to the limit where the field becomes a "pill").


## obstacles

on borders:

* spikes (a few triangular spikes out of the border);

* bumps (round bumps coming out of the border);

* inselbergs (concave spikes coming out of the border);

in the middle:

* circles;

* diamonds;

* squares;

* walls (a couple big walls)
